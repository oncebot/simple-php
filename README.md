# Simple-php
Simple-php is a tiny php framework for quickly building a web app without any configurations.
[Recommended static sites, landing pages etc. But can be modified for dynamic websites]

### Uses
* Add your php pages in views folder.
* The file name without the .php extension will be your URL for that page.
* The home.php and 404.php is required by the app, so do not rename or delete them, you can change their contents though.
* The assets folder is up to you, you can change it any way you want.
* To customize the site-wide navigation, footer, metadata etc go to views/layouts folder.
* All the views file have some php code to include the header and footer but it's not necessary, you can just write html inside those pages as well.
* .php extension is required for views.
